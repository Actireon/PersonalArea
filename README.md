I make a form for registration and login users. On native javascript (ES6). All effects are recorded using JS independently. Verification (validation) of the form with the error output. After registration, the user is saved on the backend (AJAX interaction) and can get into the personal account (login form, check, AJAX, cookies).

A stack of technologies that were used in this project: JS(ES6), CSS, AJAX, MATERIALIZE
